  &mdash; <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>
- **Source:** <https://github.com/dcf21/constellation-stick-figures>
- **Modifications:** the original `.dat` source has been re-encoded into
  JSON form with HIP-pair endpoints for use by Envision. No
  intended changes were made to the underlying stick-figure line choices.

CC BY 4.0 requires that we credit the creators and indicate any changes
we made to the licensed material. We have done both above. The
`constellation_lines.json` file also carries an embedded `"source"`
metadata block recording the same credits and license.

## Object catalog (`catalog.csv`) provenance

Portions of the original object database were derived from the **Explore
Scientific&trade; ExploreStars&trade;** database and are used with
permission from Explore Scientific. The bundled Envision
catalog has since been curated, normalized, corrected, and augmented using
public astronomical catalogues and reference services, including ESA
Hipparcos/Tycho, the Yale Bright Star Catalog where applicable, RNGC/IC,
SIMBAD/CDS, and other public astronomical resources.

The sections that follow record the specific external sources contributing
to the curated catalog.

## Star data &mdash; ESA Hipparcos / Tycho-II

Stellar entries in `catalog.csv` and the chart's `stars_mag6.json` are
derived from the European Space Agency (ESA) **Hipparcos** and
**Tycho-II** catalogues, used in accordance with the ESA data policy.

- **Credit:** ESA / Hipparcos / Tycho
- **Catalogue references:**
  - Hipparcos Catalogue (1997): VizieR I/239
  - Tycho-II Catalogue (2000): VizieR I/259

Star positions, proper motions, magnitudes and HIP / HD / HR
cross-references of about 250 entries were corrected against the **HYG
database v4.0** (David Nash, astronexus; CC BY-SA 4.0;
https://codeberg.org/astronexus/hyg), itself compiled from Hipparcos,
Yale Bright Star and Gliese (`tools/fix_catalog_from_hyg.py`).

Cross-reference identifiers used to label catalogue entries &mdash;
**Bayer**, **Flamsteed**, **SAO**, **HD / Harvard**, **DM**,
**BD / CD / CPD**, **GSC** &mdash; are public-domain naming systems and
require no additional attribution. They are listed here for transparency.

---

## Deep-sky objects &mdash; RNGC / IC

Non-stellar entries in `catalog.csv` originated with the legacy
ExploreStars catalog and trace to the **Revised New General Catalogue
(RNGC)** and the **Index Catalogue (IC)** &mdash; both in the public
domain.

## Object thumbnails &mdash; astrophotography

Object images shown on the Target page and the Star Seeker chart are sourced from:

- **Explore Scientific** &mdash; original ExploreStars project images
  (Messier objects, NGC, solar system), used with permission.
- **Jim McKee** &mdash; astrophotographs marked "Jim McKee" in the
  Target-page caption, used with permission. The California Nebula
  (`NGC1499.jpg`) has its faint oxygen layer brought out for display, with
  his OK (stars and hydrogen as he processed them). See more of his work on
  AstroBin: <https://app.astrobin.com/u/mckeejh>
- **Wes McDonald** &mdash; the Lagoon Nebula (M8), the app author's own
  photograph.
- **Ryan Wecker** &mdash; the Hercules Cluster (M13), taken on an iEXOS-100-2,
  used with permission; cropped to the cluster and scaled to 500 × 500.
- **Sean M McHenry** &mdash; LDN 1251, the Angler Fish Nebula, taken on an
  iEXOS-100-2. `images/LDN1251.jpg` (a crop around the nebula, for the Target
  page) and `images/LDN1251-wide.jpg` (his full field, for the Star Seeker
  chart), both scaled to 500 × 281 and letterboxed. Permission, in his words
  (2026-10-26): "I hereby allow the company known as Explore Scientific,
  specifically Wes McDonald, the right to use my image of LDN 1251, the Dark
  Nebula known as the Angler Fish Nebula for the purposes of their programming,
  advertising, and outreach with credit to me, Sean M McHenry, the owner of this
  artwork/image."
  - **His wide fields for the Star Seeker chart**, all on the iEXOS-100-2 with an
    SVBony SV535 lens and a ZWO ASI 585MC Pro: `images/NGC6883-wide.jpg` (Tulip
    to NGC 6883 and WR 134), `images/NGC7822-wide.jpg` (NGC 7822 and Cederblad
    214), `images/NGC7000-wide.jpg` (North America and Pelican) and
    `images/Sh2-114-wide.jpg` (the Flying Dragon) and `images/Sadr-wide.jpg` (Sadr),
    each scaled to 1400 px on its longer side, except Sadr: his 6° field, scaled from
    5376 × 3024 to 2000 × 1125. Some are lightly edited for presentation, as Sean
    allowed ("rotate and adjust the colors as needed").
  - **Target page pictures from those fields:** `images/NGC7822.jpg` (the whole
    NGC 7822 frame), and crops placed with his plate solves: `images/Ced214.jpg`
    (0.9° around NGC 7822's bright rim), `images/WR134.jpg` (0.55° around WR 134's
    ring) and `images/Sh2-104.jpg` (0.45°), the last two from the Tulip field; each
    scaled to 500 × 500.
  - **Permission, in his words (2026-10-30, adding Sadr to his 2026-10-26 list):** "I
    hereby allow Explore Scientific and Wes McDonald the right to use my images
    (listed specifically below) for the purposes of their programming, advertising,
    and outreach, with credit to me, Sean M McHenry, the owner of these images. I
    grant the above permission to use the following images which I have submitted by
    email: 1. LDN 1251 the Dark Nebula known as the Angler Fish Nebula 2. Tulip
    Nebula to NGC 6883 and the WR 134 ring (Cygnus) 3. NGC 7822 with Cederblad 214

  Target page keeps Jim McKee's close-up.
  - **The Vela Supernova Remnant**, on the G11 with an ES 80mm FCD100 APO
    (`images/VelaSNR-wide.jpg`), used with
