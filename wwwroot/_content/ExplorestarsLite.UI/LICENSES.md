  &mdash; <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>
- **Source:** <https://github.com/dcf21/constellation-stick-figures>
- **Modifications:** the original `.dat` source has been re-encoded into
  JSON form with HIP-pair endpoints for use by ExploreStars Envision. No
  intended changes were made to the underlying stick-figure line choices.

CC BY 4.0 requires that we credit the creators and indicate any changes
we made to the licensed material. We have done both above. The
`constellation_lines.json` file also carries an embedded `"source"`
metadata block recording the same credits and license.

## Object catalog (`catalog.csv`) provenance

Portions of the original object database were derived from the **Explore
Scientific&trade; ExploreStars&trade;** database and are used with
permission from Explore Scientific. The bundled ExploreStars Envision
catalog has since been curated, normalized, corrected, and augmented using
public astronomical catalogues and reference services, including ESA
Hipparcos/Tycho, the Yale Bright Star Catalog where applicable, RNGC/IC,
SIMBAD/CDS, and other public astronomical resources.

The sections that follow record the specific external sources contributing
to the curated catalog.

## Star data &mdash; ESA Hipparcos / Tycho-II

Stellar entries in `catalog.csv` and the chart's `stars_mag6.json` are
derived from the European Space Agency (ESA) **Hipparcos** and
**Tycho-II** catalogues, used in accordance with the ESA data policy.

- **Credit:** ESA / Hipparcos / Tycho
- **Catalogue references:**
  - Hipparcos Catalogue (1997): VizieR I/239
  - Tycho-II Catalogue (2000): VizieR I/259

Cross-reference identifiers used to label catalogue entries &mdash;
**Bayer**, **Flamsteed**, **SAO**, **HD / Harvard**, **DM**,
**BD / CD / CPD**, **GSC** &mdash; are public-domain naming systems and
require no additional attribution. They are listed here for transparency.

---

## Deep-sky objects &mdash; RNGC / IC

Non-stellar entries in `catalog.csv` originated with the legacy
ExploreStars catalog and trace to the **Revised New General Catalogue
(RNGC)** and the **Index Catalogue (IC)** &mdash; both in the public
domain.

## Object thumbnails &mdash; astrophotography

Object thumbnail images shown on the Target page are sourced from:

- **Explore Scientific** &mdash; original ExploreStars project images
  (Messier objects, NGC, solar system), used with permission.
- **Jim McKee** &mdash; astrophotographs marked "Jim McKee" in the
  Target-page caption, used with permission. See more of his work on
  AstroBin: <https://app.astrobin.com/u/mckeejh>
- **NASA / JPL** &mdash; specific solar-system imagery (e.g., Pluto from
  New Horizons, PIA19857), public domain.

## Planetary, solar, and lunar positions

Positions are computed from algorithms in:

> Jean Meeus, *Astronomical Algorithms*, 2nd ed., Willmann-Bell, 1998.

The mathematics is in the public domain; credit is retained here as a
courtesy to the author whose presentation made the implementation
practical.

## Acknowledgments

The catalog has been augmented with cross-references and additional
entries curated using **SIMBAD** (operated at CDS, Strasbourg, France)
and other public astronomical resources.

- SIMBAD: <https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/>

SIMBAD's published acknowledgment line is intended for academic
publications; this courtesy credit is included here for transparency
about how the catalog was curated.

Thanks to **Jerry Hubbell** of Explore Scientific, LLC, for fruitful
discussions during development and assistance with field testing.

Thanks to **Ignazio Pillitteri** for contributing the Linux/macOS PWA
server bash script (`start-servers.sh`) and Caddyfile cross-platform
improvements that enable ExploreStars Envision to run on Linux and
macOS hosts in addition to Windows.
